 <h1>Life In The Wild<br></h1>
 <p1><b1>Animals are not acknowledged enough these days,more and more animals go extinct each day and nothing is <br>
 being done about it. It's high time these animals stop being feared of and start being cared for.<br>
 Their habitats don't make them less of animals and we need to understand this quick or these animals will soon go<br>
  extinct. Just because their life is in the wild dosen't mean we have to make them feel like it.</b1></p1>
